# HooYooTracker

HooYooTracker is a webapp that scrapes Genshin Impact and Zenless Zero (WIP!) codes from various sources and compiles them into one organized list. 

## Motivation

As a fan of both games and out of boredom, I decided to create a program that would simplify the process of finding released codes from these two games without having to navigate from several websites or other sources. Another reason is that I want to improve my mastery in Python as I believe I have so many things to learn, so yeah.

## Installation and Usage

It is recommended to install the program from the Releases page to ensure you have an approved version that is less likely to have issues, rather than cloning the main branch for the latest code, which might potentially have issues.

### via Releases
1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Scoofszlo/HooYooTracker/releases) page.
2. Extract the .zip file that contains the source code.
3. Open the `HooYooTracker` folder.
4. Double-click the `run.bat`.
5. Done!

### via Git clone

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Scoofszlo/HooYooTracker.git
    ```
2. Open the `HooYooTracker` folder.
3. Double-click the `run.bat`.
4. Done!

## Notes
- **Tested only on Windows**: This program was created on a Windows laptop, so I'm not sure if this will work on other operating systems.
- **Currently supports Python v3.12 and up**: Testing on lower versions is planned, but versions below 3.8 are unlikely to be supported due to external dependency requirements.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
    ```
3. Make your changes and commit them:

    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```
4. Push to the branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/YourFeature
    ```
